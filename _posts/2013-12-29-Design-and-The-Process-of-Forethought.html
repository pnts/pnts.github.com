<p>For a streak of a 8 or 9 days I took minimalistic reading notes in the iOS app <em>Paper</em>. With each text I'd try to tease out the most fundamental concept and turn it into a short series of single-word slides. But, like an asshole, I didn't include any indication of the text being referenced and so here I sit, about six months later, desperately pawing books off shelves and tapping increasingly maniacal combinations of keywords into Google to no avail.</p>

<p>Now, decoupled from the original text, the slides have morphed into something small and unique. <em>Process of Forethought</em> I especially like and return to whenever I'm struggling with the nature and meaning of design. Not that I'm trying to justify irresponsible note-taking, but I'm interested in how the artifacts have shifted in meaning and use (I may even do it again).</p>

<p>If you happen to know what texts these are referencing, by all means holler. I'd love to know too.</p>
