<blockquote> The personal media world ... is a world where answering back is not an option - it's required. Otherwise, you don't have the personal media experience. Take Google. You don't watch Google. Watching Google would be like watching the test pattern on a TV (before test patterns went away). If you don't put something into Google first, you don't get something out. That's the world of personal media, where there are no bystanders; you have to participate to have the experience. That is profoundly new territory for people designing systems.</blockquote>
