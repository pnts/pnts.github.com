<p>In his talk, "<a href="http://www.ixda.org/resources/dan-hill-new-soft-city">New Soft City</a>" during Interaction '10, <a href="http://www.cityofsound.com/blog/2002/01/about_cityofsou.html">Dan Hill</a> emphatically illustrates an approach to urban informatics that utilizes the fabric of the city as a medium for visualization ((While not discussed in much depth, he does mention two trends that inform this position: 1) The ease in which screens can be co-opted for the purpose of advertising and 2) the efficacy of urban screens is dramatically decreasing as people learn to block them out)).</p>

<p>Hill presents a diverse range of projects he's been involved with over the years, the majority of which attempt to expose consumption metrics externally and make the invisible visible. All of the projects are incredibly inspiring (checkout the responsive architecture project for the design of the <a href="http://www.dezeen.com/2009/08/28/masdar-city-centre-by-lava/">Masdar City Center</a>), but I'm particularly struck by the collaboration with the State Library of Queensland for <em>Sense and Sustainability</em>, a platform for public art. For this project, the building housing <a href="http://edgeqld.org.au/nicta/"><em>The Edge</em></a> was layered in a sensor network in order to capture data generated by the building, which was then turned into an API. Dan has already written about the <a href="http://www.cityofsound.com/blog/2008/02/the-street-as-p.html">street as a platform</a>, and I think the <a href="http://edgeqld.org.au/nicta/category/urban-computing/">building as API</a> is a nice corollary.</p>

<p>In combination with initiatives like the <a href="http://www.haque.co.uk/eeml.php">EEML</a>, a protocol for sharing real time sensor data, and the open source approach of the <a href="http://uvs.propositions.org.uk/">Urban Versioning System</a>, a framework is starting to emerge that will give people the vocabulary and material to experiment with more complex feedback loops. We'll have access to data generated not only by our social and financial activities, but by our environment as well. While I'm not sure what this means for urban growth and development or where it lies in dialogue around "smart cities", I do think the four questions Dan closes with are something to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do people expect systems to behave?</li>
<li>How does information work as material?</li>
<li>How should we extend the capabilities of people, buildings, and infrastructure?</li>
<li>What new cities does this enable?</li>
</ul>
