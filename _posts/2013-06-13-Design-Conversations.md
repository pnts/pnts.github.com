Been going through a bit of back and forth recently with [Papa Mignolo](http://waltermignolo.com) about design and decoloniality. Throughout our conversations I've been struggling to articulate design in a way that does justice to the theory, practice, and evolution of design (not to mention why it's so important to me). The process is ongoing, but I posted my first attempt over at Medium, [How Design Gets Everywhere](https://medium.com/the-design-of-things/d869c79a6dc0).
