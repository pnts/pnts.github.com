<p><img src="/assets/img/startupbus/startupbus-small.png" alt="Startupbus Logo" title="Starupbus logo" class="alignleft" /> What is <a href="http://startupbus.com">the Startupbus</a>? A 3 day hackathon on wheels throttling towards SXSW at 75mph. Buses full of developers, designers, and hustlers leave from 12 cities with the goal of creating and pitching a startup upon arrival in Austin. Complete strangers thrown together to combat tight deadlines, motion-sickness, patchy wifi, and other obstacles all intent on making something great. Is it crazy? Totally. Is it awesome? Undoubtedly so. </p>

<p>A week ago I returned from an insanely amazing and sleep-deprived week of making (both products and friends). Together with the most kick-ass team of creative trouble-makers ((<a href="http://www.twitter.com/b9punk">Jennifer Gergen</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/freenerd">Johan Uhle</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/natecooper">Nate Cooper</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/rickyrobinett">Ricky Robinett</a>, and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/RobHanleyDesign">Robert Hanley</a> )) I could have ever wished for we created <a href="http://happstr.com">Happstr</a>, an app that tracks and analyzes happiness. </p>

<p>I'm still working on a longer post about all the shenanigans and learnings from the trip, but I wanted to take a moment to encourage <em>everyone</em> to consider applying for the bus next year. If you want to challenge yourself, meet amazing people, form new friendships, and shift your perspective, the bus is definitely for you. Want to know more? Come to the Startupbus Demo night on April 5th (details forthcoming), where you can learn more about the Startupbus, listen to pitches, and talk to some of the folks who were on the bus this year.</p>

<p>I'd also like to send out special love to <a href="http://eastmedia.com">Eastmedia</a> for sponsoring my trip, and <a href="http://simplereach.com">Simplereach</a> for making sure I came home safe and sound. </p>

<p>Oh! And be sure to check out Louisiana's bus application (( Each year cities apply for a bus, usually by massive Twitter love and retweets. Louisiana threw down the gauntlet with their music video submission. )), which has set a new bar for 2013: </p>
