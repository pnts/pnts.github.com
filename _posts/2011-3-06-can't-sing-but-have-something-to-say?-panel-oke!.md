Panel-oke combines panels and karaoke to create a more participatory and fluid approach to panels by inviting the audience to not only become the questioner, but to become the panel as well. The basic idea is that panels are re-formed in response to each question that is asked. While in play, the panel is a fluid entity and can become larger or smaller as answers are explored. In this format, the distinction between audience and participants fades away and the panel process becomes a fully collaborative event.

Traditional panel interactions happen between questioners and panels, while the audience takes on the passive role of consumer/observer. Audience members actively participate when they assume the role of questioner, but their participation is strictly limited once the initial proposition has been stated. In this format only a very small percentage of the passive audience becomes active questioners, while attempts to 'become the panel' don't even manifest as a possibility throughout the duration of the panel presentation. 

On the opposite side of the spectrum is karaoke, participatory and open at the core, its form and structure shift from moment to moment. At times a practiced veteran might skillfully control the audience and demand utmost attention and devotion. Other times a classic tune might incite the entire room to belt along with sloppy grins on their faces, swaying and singing together.

Panel + Karaoke = Panel-oke!

Panel-oke was hatched at , the annual  conference. Several tracks of the conference consisted of five 20 minute long 'lightning' presentations, followed by a panel session with all of the people who had just presented. With an audience of 650 people, the panel was able to field four or five questions before the moderator wrapped-up with a quick summary and sent us all off to lunch (or drinks). The panelists were great, the questions were great, but when you have such a high concentration of experts in one room - such a large and diverse pool of experience and knowledge to pull from - why not tap into that as well?

Over lunch Ian () and I were discussing the panels when he brilliantly mashed up panels and karaoke and exclaimed, "Panel-oke!". We pushed our mediocre noodles aside and explored the idea more. It made sense, it was plausible, and it fit with the ethos of interaction designers. Over the next couple days we bounced the idea off of people and the reception was positive. Panel-oke was viable. 



It just so happened that Ian was going to be in New York in early March, so the New York branch of the IxDA sprung into action to put on the inaugural Panel-oke event. Originally we thought we'd just have a small group of guinea pigs, but with an overwhelming 72 RSVPs we realized we had a larger event on our hands. Experimental events need a few things to work successfully: alcohol, willing participants, and in the case of Panel-oke, enough room to move about and re-form panels at will. 

To help execute the event,  offered their new space and  (aka ) plied the group with wine and beer to loosen tongues and boost courage. Mix in the enthusiastic participation of the New York Design community and it's hard to go wrong. Unexpected enhancements came by way of the PA system with two mics, and a mini-gong mysteriously housed above the fridge.

Ian has a great write-up of the event (check out the ) and sums up the logistics of Panel-oke as, 



The biggest unknown was how long a panel should last, how actively we should moderate, and how to keep the flow going. We started out with a 5 minute limit, but it quickly became apparent that a good conversation between 3 - 5 people takes about 10 - 15 minutes to get to a satisfactory concluding point (and perhaps even longer if the audience has had a shared experience). When time was up someone would bang the gong and we'd check-in with the audience to see if they wanted a new song or to continue with the current one. Using the room as a sounding-board, we navigated our way through 4 panel topics in a little under an hour.

Feedback was overall positive, and unified in the desire to encourage even more participation. Suggestions included:

Huge thanks to  for the great space,  for the generous libations which kept the whole shebang going, the  for making the entire thing happen,  for making sure it happened in the first place,  for photographic documentation, and the New York Design community for their engaged and supportive collaboration.
