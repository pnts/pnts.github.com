<p>The front-end tooling landscape has exploded recently and I'm <em>totally</em> excited about everything that's happening. If you haven't had a chance to check it out a good place to start is Addi Osmani's deck from his 2013 FOWA keynote, "<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/addyosmani/automating-front-end-workflow">Automating Frond-end Workflow</a>".</p>

<p>I've been using task runners and package managers for a while, but hadn't thought about using something like <a href="bower.io">Bower</a> to create reusable Sass modules until I came across <a href="http://fettblog.eu/">Stefan Baumgartner's</a> article, "<a href="http://fettblog.eu/blog/2014/01/13/manageable-sass-components/">Create manageable Sass Components</a>". It's a nice alternative to Git's submodules (which have bit me in the ass on more than one occasion), with the added benefit of managing versions and dependencies.</p>

<p>When it comes to Sass there's a base set of functions and mixins I rely on heavily &mdash; if I don't have them handy it's almost like I can't think. While I enjoy frameworks such as <a href="http://bourbon.io/">Bourbon</a> and <a href="http://susy.oddbird.net/">Susy</a> and learn a lot from their approach to architecting Sass, I find them too monolithic for my needs.</p>

<p>So I took the ideas in Stefan's article and published my first Bower package, <a href="https://github.com/pnts/bones">Bones</a>. It's a very lightweight set of functions, mixins, and placeholder extends that I rely on for every project, whether it's a web app, marketing site, or pet project. I've already switched this site over to Bones and it's made my life oh-so-much-easier. I'll continue to update it as needed, but if you are doing any amount of heavy lifting with Sass, consider using Bower to create reusable Sass components. You won't look back.</p>
