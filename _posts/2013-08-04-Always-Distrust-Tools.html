<blockquote>
<p>It's good to learn how to do something. It's better to learn many ways of doing something. But it's best to learn all these ways as <em>suggestions or hints</em>. Not <em>truth</em>.</p>

<p>Learn tools, and use tools, but don't <em>accept</em> tools. Always distrust them; always be alert for alternative ways of thinking. This is what I mean by avoiding the conviction that you "know what you're doing".</p>
