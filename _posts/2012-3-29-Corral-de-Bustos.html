<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corral_de_Bustos">Corral de Bustos</a>, population 11,000, is a small town in the pampas of Argentina.  <a href="http://waltermignolo.com/about-2/">Papa Mignolo</a> grew up there, my grandmother still lives there, and we are related to roughly half the town. The playground adjacent to the central plaza is where my brother received a huge electrical shock, and where I split my chin open on a see-saw ((the events did not happen concurrently, but rather 15 years apart, though causality-wise they are more closely related.)).</p>

<p>In December of 2011 I went back to visit and used the boy's Canon EOS-1 VH (with Kodak 400 TX film) to shoot the town. Though the trip is just a few months removed, the black and white film does an amazing job of manifesting memories that are already fading, and capturing the constant nostalgia I feel for Corral de Bustos, even when I am there.</p>

<p class="caption">This gate, and the wall it is attached to, is the only thing remaining of the house where my father grew up. My grandfather would smoke cigarettes by the gate and watch the world go by, while my father and his cousins played in the street.</p>

<p class="caption">This is my grandmother&#039;s house (the small part; the large building in back is a warehouse). She&#039;s lived here ever since I can remember, and not much has changed. Even the photos on the walls remain the same...</p>

<p class="caption">The night of the great asado. I was so full of meat and wine I forgot to take photos, but this happened about an hour before and still serves to trigger my memory.</p>
