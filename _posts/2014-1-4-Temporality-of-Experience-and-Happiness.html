<blockquote>...happiness is an enduring life appreciation, representing the extent to which one is satisfied with the life one leads. It thereby excludes the short-lived moments that are considered to be moments of happiness in everyday dialogue, like the delight in a cup of tea at breakfast, the satisfaction of a chore done, or the enjoyment of a piece of art. This signifies an important difference between design for experience (or emotion) and design for happiness: <strong>design for experience generally focuses on short-term experiences, whereas design for happiness focuses on long-term life appreciation</strong> [highlight mine].</blockquote>

<p>After reading this paper I can't stop noodling over the use of temporality to distinguish between designing for experience and designing for happiness. Overall I think the nuance is interesting, though it should be noted the authors use the term 'experience' as a proxy for 'product experience', rather than a larger notion of experience encompassing fields like service or healthcare experience design.</p>
