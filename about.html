<h1>What's up with this place?</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/img/about/pnts-icon.png" alt="" title="icon" width="150" class="alignleft icon" />What is this place?  It&#8217;s a framework for my thoughts and a notebook for my notes.  From time to time I add pictures as well.  It&#8217;s not really about <em>any</em> one thing, maybe more about <em>every</em> one thing, at some point or another.  If that isn&#8217;t vague enough for you, just consider it a place for writing stuff down.</p>

<p>My name is Andrea Mignolo &mdash; pronounced anne-DRAY-ah, not anne-DREE-ah &mdash; and though I won&#8217;t correct you if you say it wrong, it silently irks me when you do.  If you can&#8217;t keep it straight, just call me Andi, or even pnts<sup>[<a href="#footnote_0_617" id="identifier_0_617" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="pnts, pronounced pants, from the nickname andisandipants, but spelled without an &amp;#8216;a&amp;#8217;.  It&amp;#8217;s probably the easiest way to get my attention&amp;#8230; even my mom calls me pnts.  Really.">1</a>]</sup>.  The whole thing is pretty moot considering we are interfacing via a the web, but there it is.</p>

<p>I like windmills, funny hats, spinach, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pnts/sets/72157602286941303/">ducks</a>, and beer.  I also really like bourbon and soup; so much in fact, that for years I&#8217;ve dreamed of opening a shop that&#8217;s a soup cafe by day and a whiskey bar by night, though I still haven&#8217;t come up with a good name for the place.  Conversely, I don&#8217;t like Scrappy Doo or asshats, and I downright despise pretzels, which means you&#8217;ll never catch me running a Scrappy Doo pretzel joint<sup>[<a href="#footnote_1_617" id="identifier_1_617" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="And the world is a better place for it.">2</a>]</sup>.</p>

<p>I &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 the internet.  Every facet of it is intriguing; where it came from and where it's going, what it was built on, how people want to change it and how it changes people, to name a few.  I love it so much that in <a href="http://oberlin.edu">college</a> I created my own major, Technocultural Studies, so I could be vaguely academic about it.</p>

<p>By trade I&#8217;m an interaction and interface designer who is deeply interested in empathy, interactions, systems, networks, time, cities, play, and sustainability.</p>

<p>Currently I&#8217;m living in New York City with the <a href="http://kenntam.com">husband-boy</a> and a smattering of plants. </p>
