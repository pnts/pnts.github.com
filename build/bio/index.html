    <h2>Don't Forget the Design!</h2>
    <p><a href="https://pnts.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/dont-forget-design.pdf">Presentation slides</a></p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>Stepping into leadership positions heralds a change in our roles and responsibilities, and often includes a shift from hands-on design to more strategic and operational management. At this level our success depends on a thorough understanding of the business and partnering with departments across the organization. But what does design look like when we’re no longer designing products and services? What are we designing?</p>

    <p>As we navigate these new realms it can be hard to find the language to bridge the logic of business with the sensemaking of design. How can we be good business partners and designers? Faced with a lack of intelligibility between the two realms it can feel like we have to choose one or the other. Together we’ll explore the relationship between business and design, examine ways to resolve tensions between the two realms, and check out a new lens through which to understand the value of design.</p>

    <h2>Eat Only Elk: Authenticity, Transformation, and the Business of Design</h2>
    <p><a href="https://pnts.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/eat-only-elk.pdf">Presentation slides</a></p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>Over the past decade the role of design has taken on greater organizational significance. Today design leaders must focus not only on creating great products and services, but on transforming business through the power of design. But what about our own personal transformation? We pour so much time into building teams, operationalizing design, developing strategy, and creating value for our companies that it can be hard to keep sight of what happens to us in the process. If personal transformation lays the foundation for organizational change, how do we make space to show up fully and be our authentic selves in a professional environment? This talk will explore the question of self transformation in the context of work life and look at how inner struggles can expand our understanding of what it means to be a professional, a leader, and a designer.</p>

    <p>When a company embraces good design it permeates not only the product but the entire customer and subscriber experience. However, in organizations big and small, how email and email design affects these experiences is often an afterthought. This talk will provide email designers with actionable ideas and best practices to step up and use design leadership to create better emails, amplify their influence with their colleagues, and have an impact across the broader organization.</p>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>We’ve been fighting the good fight to get design at the table. Across companies large and small it’s becoming standard to have design sit alongside business and engineering as a core partner. But getting to the table is just the beginning. What happens once you’re there?</p>
