    <p>Frederick Laloux</p>

    <p><em>This book</em>. Combining Spiral Dynamics with Ken Wilber's Integral Theory, Laloux examines the evolution of organizational models alongside the evolution of human consciousness. He includes case studies of 12 organizations operating at the 'holistic' or 'teal' level, covering structures, practices, and cultures which include self-management, wholeness, and evolutionary purpose. As if the book wasn't enough, Laloux launched a follow-up video series, <a href="https://thejourney.reinventingorganizations.com/">Insights for the Journey</a>, that's definitely worth a watch (or five).</p>

    <p>Peter Senge</p>

    <p>Senge, like Deming before him, is interested in transforming the way we manage our organizations asserting that there are "ways of working together that are vastly more satisfying and more productive than the prevailing system of management." Most managers focus on short-term performance improvements creating cultures of uniformity and compliance. In contrast, Senge believes that a culture of learning based on aspiration, understanding complexity, and reflective conversations leads to more successful and humanistic organizations. But our organizations work the way they do because of how we work as individuals - in order to change our organizations we have to change ourselves.</p>

    <p>David Whyte</p>

    <p>What happens when you put a poet inside corporate America? This book. Through poetry and prose, David Whyte takes on nothing less than what it means to be whole and authentic at work. Calling for more humanity in the workplace and asking us to address the deep fears we usually keep hidden, this book is a masterpiece of wisdom, learning, and leadership. Not to mention you will have a whole new appreciation for Beowulf! </p>

    <p>"Magical leverage points are not easily accessible, even if we know where they are and which direction to push them. There are no cheap tickets to mastery. You have to work hard at it, whether that means rigorously analyzing a system or rigorously casting off your own paradigms and throwing yourself into the humility of not-knowing. In the end, it seems that mastery has less to do with pushing leverage points than it does with strategically, profoundly, madly, letting go and dancing with the system."</p>

    <p>Chris Laszlo and Judy Sorum Brown</p>

    <p>I don't know about you, but I sure do love the word flourishing. Laszlo and Brown build on the history of management theory and organizational development by integrating the two strands and arguing (convincingly) for the connection between spirituality and business success. Don't worry, this book doesn't get all religious on you! Sprituality in this context is described as a deep sense of caring - for self, for others, and for the world. We can develop our capacity to care through reflective practices that help us understand the nature of beliefs and how they shape our thinking and behaviors. And when we can change our behaviors, we can change ourselves <em>and</em> our organizations. </p>

    <p>Ever wish you could have a book filled with all the models of design processes in existence? Wish no further! Dubberly has done the hard work of finding and annotating various models of what it means to design,and YOU get the fun task of sitting back and pondering the plurality of processes (nice alliteration, hey?).</p>

    <p>How do desigers work and what does it mean to design? Design isn't magic but the ways in which designers work can seem elusive (and in the 70s when this book was being written it largely was). Jones' work is an attempt to demystify the process and show how intuition and rationality can co-exist in the design process.</p>

    <p>George Nelson pretty much brought Herman Miller into the modern age and in the process he got to hang with some pretty amazing designers (Ray and Charles Eames, Harry Bertoia, Isamu Noguchi, et al.). He also spent a good amount of time reflecting on what it means to design, earning him the epithet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadesign">metadesigner</a>. In 'On Design' Nelson applies design to pretty much everything from furniture to organizations to society, often with a prescient understanding of the challenges we face today. </p>

    <p>Rosamund Stone Zander and Benjamin Zander</p>

    <p>Just like I never thought I'd have a favorite physicist (Feynam), I never thought I'd have a favorite conductor (Zander). And yet here we are. If you don't feel like reading the book pop over to Youtube and watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKEBygQic0">How to Give an A</a> to get a feel for Zander's enthusiasm and positivity. 'The Art of Possibility' is a rumination on how we encounter reality, the assumptions that block us, and the art of rearranging ourselves. The book is structured around nine simple practices that give us ways to work with rigid perceptions and belief systems. While the practices are simple they're definitely not easy, making this a book to come back to over and over again.  </p>

    <p>Terry Winograd and Fernando Flores</p>

    <p>Winograd and Flores set out to reorient to how we design and use computer systems and in the process wrote a treatise on ontological design. </p>

    <p>"In ontological designing we are doing more than asking what can be built. We are engaging in a philosophical discourse about the self – about what we can do and what can be. Tools are fundamental to action, and through our actions we generate the world. The transformation we are concerned with is not a technical one, but a continuing evolution of how we understand our surroundings and ourselves – of how we continue becoming the beings we are."</p>

    <p>Excuse me while I nerd out for a second, but Maturana's ideas around the 'braiding of languaging and emotioning' as they relate to lineages could provide insight into how organizational cultures grow and evolve. I'm still working on this theory but in the meantime give Maturana's writings a whirl. They're somewhat non-linear but the freshness of his perspective is bound to get your neurons firing.</p>
