<p>I was in Portland last month for <a href="https://untappd.com/user/pnts/checkin/75777309">beer</a>, <a href="https://untappd.com/user/pnts/checkin/75930287">beer</a>, and <a href="http://emberconf.com/">EmberConf</a> (mostly EmberConf), where I met a great group of people building <a href="http://emberjs.com/">ambitious applications in Ember</a>. The talks are all available online, and if you're doing Ember development of any sort or interested in getting started, <a href="http://emberconf.com/schedule.html">go watch them all now</a>.</p>

<p>One of the more incidental takeaways that keeps popping into my head during idle moments came from Edward Faulkner's talk, "<a href="http://confreaks.com/videos/3302-emberconf2014-animations-and-transitions-in-an-ember-app">Animations and Transitions in an Ember App</a>". In the first five minutes Edward uses the phrase, 'skeuomorphic behavior' to explain why scrolling has momentum in a medium with no physical limitations - our monkey brains just aren't quick enough to fully process instantanous changes in a system. If we're lucky we know *something* happened, but not exactly what. Ted Neslon said something similar a few years ago at Brooklyn Beta, which I may or not be correctly paraphrasing but remember it as, "animation is orientation in orthogonal space." </p>

<p>What I like about the phrase 'skeuomorphic behavior' is the nuance. For a while, debates about skeuomorphism by and large referred to visual ornamentation to aid in understanding the <em>what</em> of digital objects. Teasing apart the definition and applying it to wider systems of interaction changes skeuomorphism from a passing visual trend into a useful tool for thinking about digital systems. Sound is also a good candidate for skeuomorphic structures that assist in digital wayfinding - apps like Tweetbot and Airmail make nuanced use of sound to communicate the type of action being taken.</p>
