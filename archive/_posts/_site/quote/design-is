<blockquote>The word design is everything and nothing. We think of design as not just the product's appearance: it's what the product is and how it works. The design and the product are inseparable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think it's this veneer &mdash; that the designers are handed this box and told, 'Make it look good!' That's not what we think design is. It's not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.</blockquote>

<p>Apple's design philosophy is nothing if not direct and concise, which I'm guessing is one of the (many) reasons their level of focus and execution is so incredibly high. As we begin building out the design practice at SimpleReach I've been thinking a lot about design leadership, ways to foster understanding and purpose across divisions, and approaches to creating a strong design culture. Nothing worth sharing right now, but tidbits from my research will likely wind up here.</p>
