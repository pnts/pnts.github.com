<blockquote>The objects of production in the knowledge economy have value if they convey research, design, image or information content. In short: of meaning. The value of the meaning of what we do, the direction in which we are moving, seems to be the basic key to the contemporary world. This leads the organization of production to constantly address the narrative, cognitive, social, scientific, technological and creative dynamics out of which the meanings the population prefers arise. The system works on the basis of the logic of complexity, in which every element is connected to every other.</blockquote>
