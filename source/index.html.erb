    <h1>ðŸ‘‹ I'm <%= link_to('Andrea', 'bio') %>, an <a href="https://methodandmatter.com"
      >executive and leadership coach</a> working at the intersection of business, design, and people. </h1>

    <p>I spend a lot of time <%= link_to('talking', 'speaking') %> and <%= link_to('writing', 'https://medium.com/@pnts', :class => 'medium') %> about <a href="https://medium.com/@pnts/learning-through-worldmaking-the-design-way-b0ed38cefc12">my own understanding of design</a>, what goes into building <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/pnts/disney-vs-pixar-a-tale-of-creative-leadership">high-performance teams</a>, and what <a href="https://medium.com/@pnts/priorities-capacity-and-support-a-dialogue-for-teams-a4decef1db1f">meaningful organizations</a> might look like. I'm also working on a book based on a talk I gave several years ago, titled "<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/pnts/new-on-the-job-your-first-90-days-in-a-design-leadership-role">New On the Job: Your First 90 Days in a Design Leadership Role</a>". You can follow along as I keep track of resources in <a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/app/design-leadership/page/CPoLCQI-e">Roam</a>, and post writing and reflections on Medium (official book website coming soon).</p>
