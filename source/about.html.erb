    <p>Inquire, create, reflect. Design is fundamentally an interactive way of learning, responding, and shaping our futures. Design has no subject matter so it can be applied to anything, even organizations. Design has made a lot of progress and now has a seat at the table, but is still confined to narrow areas of designing products and services. I believe design has a fundamental role in navigating the complexities of the 21st century. Not in a Bauhaus style designer-as-god way, but in the act of facilitating, co-creating, and navigating ambiguity. The edges. Maybe something about the edges. </p>

      <p>Our organizations are relics of 19th century industrial ways of working, from structures to processes to operating principles. Here in the 21st century we've rapidly moved through waves of technological progress and the old ways of working no longer serve us. The metaphor of organization as machine has given way to organization as complex organism. Command-and-control bureaucracies are too slow and inflexible to respond to ever-changing market conditions. How do we co-create new ways of working that honors what it means to be human, fosters continuous learning, and creates a competitive advantage?</p>

    <p>Inquiry. Philosophical underpinnings, but what we ask will guide what is possible. Possibility is critical to inquiry - our deficit-based thinking (largely coming out of TQM and other management theories) will only keep us mired in our current realities. Curiosity & questions drive learning. </p>

    <p>Creation. Put something into the world and see what happens. Traditionally with design that has been a product, a prototype, a piece of software, a service to be experienced. But it could also be new ways of having conversations, ways to hold space and create psychological safety, storytelling as ways of building organizations. </p>

    <p>Reflection. What did our creation teach us about our inquiry? What held true? What was surprising? What didn't work? All of these questions go back into refining our inquiry and progressing through the design loop again. Reflection is one of the most powerful steps of learning (or pieces of learning or practices we can create). </p>
