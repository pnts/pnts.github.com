<p>At <a href="http://simplereach.com">SimpleReach</a> we spend a lot of time investigating, among other things, the motley social behavior of digital content. We ingest the links people share in a perpetual, frantic choreography of likes, pins, +1s, and tweets, and look for patterns that can predict the next few hours of social traffic to any given url. We see <em>a lot</em> of content and sharing in a 24 hour period which, internally, we look at all day in the form of charts, graphs, leaderboards, logs, and reports. Publically we’ve written a few blog posts about our research and spent a beer-fueld week building the <a href="http://nativeadvertising.com">sponsored content leaderboard</a>, but other than that, the data is pretty much under lock and key.</p>  

<p>When we started designing our first official marketing site (upgraded from a <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/716975-Simplereach-Beta">sign-up-form-slash-holding page</a> laqured in lighting effects, box shadows, and texture) one of the requirements was to incorporate our data in some way. After a bit of exploration we found the best approach was to visualize the relative sharing activity between social networks over a 24 hour period.</p>

<p>We looked into a number of different visualization techniques before settling on the streamgraph for it’s visual appeal and architectural interestingness.</p>

<blockquote>The horizontal flow of the river represents the flow of time. Each vertical section of the river corresponds to an ordered time slice. Each theme is represented by a colored current that runs horizontally within the river. The width of a current changes to reflect the strength of the corresponding theme over time. As the occurrence of a theme increases over time, the corresponding current widens. As a theme’s occurrence decreases over time, the corresponding current narrows. (Theme River: In Search of Trends, Patterns, and Relationships)</blockquote>

<p>The streamgraph on our marketing site visualizes the frequency of social actions over time across six major social networks. The graph displays data over the last 24 hours and updates every 10 minutes causing the height of the stream to undulate across the width of the screen. It’s an interesting way to gauge the ebbs and flows of social actions throughout the days and weeks. It’s also had some intriguing side effects.</p>

<p>Personally, I check the site throughout the day to get a sense of how things are going. Facebook has been dominating, while the other five social networks tend to alternate in terms of 2nd, 3rd, place. StumbleUpon occasionally has spikes of activity, and Twitter waxes and wanes. Unsurprisingly, if you remove Facebook from the visualization, the graph becomes much more interesting.</p>

<p>We work with a lot of large publishers who drive significant traffic on a daily basis. Sometimes when we onboard a particularly large one and the implementation isn’t quite right, it can have some interesting effects:</p>

<p>How we can make it better:
Make it more interactive - add and remove networks. Add in custom timeframes - maybe the last week, as opposed to the last 24 hours. Consider a layout algorithm that caters more specifically to the statistical properties of our particular data set (reference streamgraph paper, section 5.4)</p>
