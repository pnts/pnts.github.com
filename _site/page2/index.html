        <p><img src="/assets/img/startupbus/startupbus-small.png" alt="Startupbus Logo" class="alignleft" /> What is <a href="http://startupbus.com">the Startupbus</a>? A 3 day hackathon on wheels throttling towards SXSW at 75mph. Buses full of developers, designers, and hustlers leave from 12 cities with the goal of creating and pitching a startup upon arrival in Austin. Complete strangers thrown together to combat tight deadlines, motion-sickness, patchy wifi, and other obstacles all intent on making something great. Is it crazy? Totally. Is it awesome? Undoubtedly so. </p>


<p>A week ago I returned from an insanely amazing and sleep-deprived week of making (both products and friends). Together with the most kick-ass team of creative trouble-makers<sup>[<a href="#footnote_0_792" id="identifier_0_792" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Jennifer Gergen, Johan Uhle, Nate Cooper, Ricky Robinett, and Robert Hanley ">1</a>]</sup> I could have ever wished for we created <a href="http://happstr.com">Happstr</a>, an app that tracks and analyzes happiness. </p>

<p>I'm still working on a longer post about all the shenanigans and learnings from the trip, but I wanted to take a moment to encourage <em>everyone</em> to consider applying for the bus next year. If you want to challenge yourself, meet amazing people, form new friendships, and shift your perspective, the bus is definitely for you. Want to know more? Come to the Startupbus Demo night on April 5th (details forthcoming), where you can learn more about the Startupbus, listen to pitches, and talk to some of the folks who were on the bus this year.</p>

<p>I'd also like to send out special love to <a href="http://eastmedia.com">Eastmedia</a> for sponsoring my trip, and <a href="http://simplereach.com">Simplereach</a> for making sure I came home safe and sound. </p>
<p>Oh! And be sure to check out Louisiana's bus application<sup>[<a href="#footnote_1_792" id="identifier_1_792" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Each year cities apply for a bus, usually by massive Twitter love and retweets. Louisiana threw down the gauntlet with their music video submission. ">2</a>]</sup>, which has set a new bar for 2013: </p>

          <h2>interaction design, interface, and mobile </h2>
          <time> January 16, 2012 </time>
        </header>
        
        <p><img src="/assets/img/nw-mobile/icon.png" alt="Nabewise touch icon" class="alignleft" />New York has about 244 neighborhoods, depending on who you ask. Some large, others small, and many nested within each other like Russian dolls. The differences between them can be bold or subtle, obvious or hidden, and not always available to the immediate senses. Bringing these differences to light, providing insight and context to location, is something <a href="http://nabewise.com">NabeWise</a> is just a <em>little</em> obsessed with. A few weeks ago we released <a href="http://blog.nabewise.com/2011/11/nabewise-launches-new-mobile-site/">Version 2</a> of our mobile site, combining geolocation with quantitative and qualitative data to provide profiles for neighborhoods as they are traversed. Because the new mobile experience is vastly different from its predecessor, I thought it might be interesting to capture the reasoning and process that lead to the version we have today.</p>


<h2>The Problem:</h2>

<p>The first mobile site<sup>[<a href="#footnote_0_714" id="identifier_0_714" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Going with a web approach allowed us to explore mobile ideas available to all platforms. While native apps are in the product roadmap, we knew we wanted to build out the web side first.">1</a>]</sup> we built was feature rich and duplicated a considerable amount of the desktop experience. We even included city maps and neighborhood overlays with the option to track your location in real-time, which was totally awesome when taking the train up to Boston and zipping through all the neighborhoods in Queens, but fairly cumbersome otherwise. In product meetings we'd discuss technical approaches to speeding up the application until one day we finally realized we didn't want a faster version of the current app, but a different app entirely - an app whose sole purpose was to answer the basic question, "Where am I?"</p>

<p>There are a number of different ways people navigate cities, two of the most common being destination directed (going from point a to point b) and discovery directed (wandering by whim and serendipity). When trying to reach a specific destination people generally care more about the how (how do I get <em>there</em>?) and the <em>specific where</em>, while people who are taking a more exploratory and less directed approach care more about the what and the <em>general where</em> (where am I and what is its story?). Google Maps does a stellar job pinpointing the specific coordinates at which you happen to be standing and what streets, stores, and intersections are nearby, but it doesn't help very much with the slightly less specific context and <em>general where</em> embodied by a neighborhood.</p>

<p>And that's what we wanted our mobile app to do &#8211; provide an answer to the question of general where, and in the process maybe even settle a few bar bets<sup>[<a href="#footnote_1_714" id="identifier_1_714" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="In New York it&amp;#8217;s not uncommon to overhear people arguing about what neighborhood they are in, especially at bars">2</a>]</sup>. </p>

<h2>Then what?</h2>

<p>With a freshly defined purpose we set out to discuss details which, naturally, requires beer. We hashed through possibilities and potentials, argued about functionality and features, and threw around ideas until we settled on a core set of content<sup>[<a href="#footnote_2_714" id="identifier_2_714" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Core content: description, photograph, reputation, top attributes, real estate values, reviews.">3</a>]</sup>. We dropped the city map and location tracking, search, and even navigation in the process. It was a gruesome battle, but in the end we were rather satisfied with our work.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/nw-mobile/r_screen1.png" alt="Intro screen" class="alignright" />Sketching on a stack of paper wireframes we explored a variety of interface ideas. The narrowed, focused set of content we had selected led us in new directions and demanded to be handled appropriately. At every step of the way the temptation to add &#8220;just one more thing&#8221; was strong, but we disciplined ourselves, asked why at every turn, and ultimately prevailed in keeping the app focused on that one question, &#8220;Where am I?&#8221; So focused in fact, that the site boasts only one button which reads, &#8220;Where am I?&#8221;</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/nw-mobile/r_screen2.png" alt="Murray Hill screenshot" class="alignright" />Visually the mobile site inherits from the web app, though the background is new and is actually a map of SoHo from the early 20th century. <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/321730-Bendy-the-Llama">Bendy</a> (our friendly NabeWise llama) makes an appearance on the error screen, which generally pops up if you are in a city we don&#8217;t currently cover. Neighborhood information is displayed in a vertical list eliminating the need for extra taps. While we removed any form of global, structured navigation, there are a few different ways you can navigate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Through <a href="http://blog.nabewise.com/2011/10/nabewise-simplifies-the-neighborhood-puzzle/">neighborhood containment</a>, which is what we call our system for determining relationships between neighborhoods. If you happen to be in a neighborhood that contains or is contained by another neighborhood, we&#8217;ll show you the surrounding context and ways to view those neighborhoods.</li>
  <li>Physically navigate to another neighborhood</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#8217;s the second method of navigation I love about version two; you must physically move yourself in the world to navigate through the site. The idea of transportation paths and patterns as interface is intriguing, and while our site only scratches the surface, it&#8217;s a topic I&#8217;ll continue to explore.  </p>

<h2>And so?</h2>

<p>And so we&#8217;ve launched! If you&#8217;re in any of the cities we currently cover, definitely check it out. It&#8217;s not the kind of app that will bug you 20 times a day or make you feel overwhelmed with information; rather it&#8217;s the kind of app that&#8217;s there when you need it, with enough information to help but not hinder, and let you go about your day when you are done. </p>
