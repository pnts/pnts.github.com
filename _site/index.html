          <h2>cities, decision-making, and publics </h2>
          <time> April 10, 2012 </time>
        </header>
        
        <p>A while ago the Architectural League of New York put out one of their <a href='http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/'><em>Situated Technologies</em></a> pamphlets exploring the concept of <a href='http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/files/ST6-MicroPublicPlaces.pdf'><em>Micropublic Places</em></a>, in which the intersection of ambient intelligence, human computing, architecture, social engineering, and urbanism act as sites for re-imagining the public realm (in this reading the idea of public realm is taken from Arendt and Latour as, &#8220;a contested space ruled by antagonism rather than conformism&#8221;).</p>

<p>Some of this reminds me of Dan Hill&#8217;s explorations into <a href='http://www.cityofsound.com/blog/2011/12/brains-cities-neuroscience-decision-making.html?'>neuroscience and cultures of decision-making</a> and the Helsinki Design Lab&#8217;s work in understanding <a href='http://www.helsinkidesignlab.org/blog/week-151'>local decision-making cultures</a>, but the <em>really</em> interesting part is the consideration and inclusion of <em>things</em> in the dialogue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One only has to take a closer look to realize that technical objects have always been things in the original sense of the word, merely concealing their complicated networks of relationships under smooth and perfect surfaces. Confronted with things like cars, nuclear reactors, baby milk, mobile phones, etc., we are forced to acknowledge &#8220;external&#8221;&#8221; forces that exist within things. So Latour writes with good reason, &#8220;What the etymology of the word thing &#8230; had conserved for us mysteriously as a sort of fabulous and mythical past has now become, for all to see, our most ordinary present&#8221;&#8220;. Moreover, in a globalized world, things—including the accidents they cause and their potential misuse—connect us more than kinship, identity, or territory. We have become cosmopolitans gathered together by things rather than by nationalities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#151; <a href='http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/files/ST6-MicroPublicPlaces.pdf'>Micropublic Places</a></p>

<p>This is important to consider as we attempt to solve the wicked problems confronting us. How do we make visible what is hidden, how do we give representation to things that have never been afforded such? And when we do, how does this impact cultures of decision-making?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Contemporary cities don’t resemble the Greek polis. Rather, they are gigantic households in which private matters take on public relevance. Under such circumstances it is hard to find a place to represent Greenland’s glaciers or the migration flows from the South, or, for that matter, any form of the avant-garde. But we know for sure that the local problems can’t be solved without taking into consideration global warming, global migration, and time battering the earth. How do we give them a voice?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#151; <a href='http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/files/ST6-MicroPublicPlaces.pdf'>Micropublic Places</a></p>

<p>Indeed, how <em>do</em> we give them a voice?</p>

        <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corral_de_Bustos">Corral de Bustos</a>, population 11,000, is a small town in the pampas of Argentina.  <a href="http://waltermignolo.com/about-2/">Papa Mignolo</a> grew up there, my grandmother still lives there, and we are related to roughly half the town. The playground adjacent to the central plaza is where my brother received a huge electrical shock, and where I split my chin open on a see-saw<sup>[<a href="#footnote_0_823" id="identifier_0_823" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="the events did not happen concurrently, but rather 15 years apart, though causality-wise they are more closely related.">1</a>]</sup>.</p>

<p>In December of 2011 I went back to visit with the boy&#8217;s Canon EOS-1 VH (using Kodak 400 TX film). Though the trip is just a few months removed, the black and white film does an amazing job of manifesting fading memories and capturing the omnipresent nostalgia I feel for Corral de Bustos, even when I am there.</p>

<img src="/assets/img/corral/the_gate.jpg" alt="The Gate where Mingo smoked" title="The Gate" />
<p class="caption">This gate, and the wall it is attached to, is the only thing remaining of the house where my father grew up. My grandfather would smoke cigarettes by the gate and watch the world go by, while my father and his cousins played in the street.</p>

<img src="/assets/img/corral/corral.jpg" alt="Corral de Bustos city sign" title="Corral de Bustos" />
<p class="caption">The old train station adjacent to downtown Corral. Buses now bring people in and out of town at laughably odd hours.</p>

<img src="/assets/img/corral/pampas.jpg" alt="The Pampas" title="The Pampas" />
<p class="caption">This is probably the second most common sight in the pampas. The first? Everyone and their mother playing soccer.</p>

<img src="/assets/img/corral/soya.jpg" alt="Soya" title="Soya" />
<p class="caption">Monsanto has largely taken ove the  agricultural landscape with soya monocrops.</p>

<p class="caption">Old grain silos.</p>

<img src="/assets/img/corral/farmacia.jpg" alt="Pharmacy in downtown Corral de Bustos" title="Farmacia" />
<p class="caption">Downtown Corral de Bustos. I swear this was taken in 2011, not 1970.</p>

<img src="/assets/img/corral/la_cuisine.jpg" alt="La Cuisine restaurant" title="La Cuisine"  />
<p class="caption">Should you ever find yourself in Corral de Bustos, go to here. We ordered lunch and dinner from La Cuisine for over a week and everything was mouthwateringly-amazing.</p>

<img src="/assets/img/corral/nieves.jpg" alt="Nieves house" title="Nieves house" />
<p class="caption">This is my grandmother&#039;s house (the small part; the large building in back is a warehouse). She&#039;s lived here ever since I can remember, and not much has changed. Even the photos on the walls remain the same...</p>

<img src="/assets/img/corral/dogs_and_cons.jpg" alt="Dogs and cons" title="Dogs and cons" />
<p class="caption">The night of the great asado. I was so full of meat and wine I forgot to take photos, but this happened about an hour before and still serves to trigger my memory.</p>

<ol class="footnotes"><li id="footnote_0_823" class="footnote">Temporally the events are rather far apart (about 15 years), but causality-wise they intricately entwined. <a href="#identifier_0_823" class="footnote-link footnote-back-link">&#8617;</a></li></ol>
